# Backend Documentation

## 1. Overview
This backend is a REST API built using Flask for managing a pizza restaurant. It allows the management of pizzas, toppings, and users, with JWT authentication for security. The system supports role-based access control with different permissions for owners and chefs.

## 2. Installation and Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip3 (Python package installer)
- MongoDB Compass
- MongoDB Atlas (for remote connections)
- pre-commit (for linting and conformed code)
- Visual Studio Code

### 2.2 Installation

#### 1. Ensure you are at root of backend (/prima_pizza/backend/)

#### 2. Create a virtual environment- This may differ depending on your OS

MacOS:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv 
```

#### 3. Activate your newly created virtual environment - This may differ depending on your OS

MacOS:
```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

#### 4. Install project dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 5. Set up MongoDB

Ensure that your MongoDB instance is running. If youâ€™re using a local instance, the default connection will usually be mongodb://localhost:27017/.

Alternatively, you can use a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas and update the connection string in your configuration.

#### 6. Create and set environment variables in backend/instance

If in LOCAL development:
```bash
touch local.env
```

If in DEV development:
```bash
touch dev.env
```

Sample local.env:

```
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DEBUG=True
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
DATABASE_URL="your_database_url"
```

#### 7. In your terminal, set the ENV variable to either "LOCAL" ,"DEV", or "TEST"
```bash
export ENV=LOCAL
```
OR
```bash
export ENV=DEV
``` 
OR
```bash
export ENV=TEST
``` 

> You'll get an error running tests in any other env other than TEST instructing to switch ENV's

```bash
ImportError while loading conftest '/Users/user/prima_pizza/backend/services/prima_pizza/tests/conftest.py'.
services/prima_pizza/tests/conftest.py:13: in <module>
    pytest.exit("Tests can only be run in the TEST environment. Please set the ENV environment variable to 'TEST'.", returncode=1)
E   _pytest.outcomes.Exit: Tests can only be run in the TEST environment. Please set the ENV environment variable to 'TEST'.
```


#### 8. Start the application from /backend root
```bash
python3 -m services.prima_pizza.app
```

- The API will start on localhost:5005

## 4. Error Handling

### 4.1 Unauthorized

If the request is missing a valid JWT token or the token is invalid, a 401 Unauthorized error is returned with this message:

```js
{"message": "Missing or invalid token"}, 401
```

### 4.2 Forbidden

If the authenticated user does not have the correct role (e.g., trying to access owner-only or chef-only routes), a 403 Forbidden error is returned:

```js
{"message": "Unauthorized"}, 403
```

### 4.3 Not Found

If a requested resource (pizza or topping) does not exist, a 404 Not Found error is returned:

```js
{"message": "Pizza not found"}, 404  or {"message": "Topping not found"}, 404
```

## 5. Security

### 5.1 JWT Authentication

#### The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. Users must log in to receive a token, which is then used to authenticate requests to protected routes (e.g., adding or deleting pizzas).


### 5.2 Role-based Access Control:

#### There are two roles: owner and chef.
```yaml
Owner: Can add or delete toppings.
Chef: Can add or delete pizzas.
```

*Only users with the appropriate role can access certain routes.


## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Check for Installed Dependencies

Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6.2 Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
venv/bin/python -m pytest services/prima_pizza/tests
```

This will execute all the tests in the tests directory and provide a summary of the test results.

### 6.3 Checking Test Coverage

To check the test coverage, you can use the `pytest-cov` plugin. Install it using:
```bash
pip install pytest-cov
```

To run standard tests without coverage reporting:
```bash
venv/bin/python -m pytest services/prima_pizza/tests
```

To run tests WITH coverage reporting:
```bash
venv/bin/python pytest --cov=services/prima_pizza/tests/
```

This will provide a detailed report of your test coverage.

### 6.4 Debugging Test Failures

If your tests do not pass, follow these steps to debug:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `ENV` environment variable is set to `TEST`.
   ```bash
   export ENV=TEST
   ```

2. **Check Database Configuration**: Ensure that your test database is correctly configured in `backend/instance/test.env`.

3. **Review Test Output**: Look at the test output to identify which tests are failing and why. The output will provide details on the assertions that failed.

4. **Run Individual Tests**: Run individual tests to isolate issues.
   ```bash
   venv/bin/pytest -m path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name
   ```

5. **Use Debugging Tools**: Use debugging tools like `pdb` to step through your code and identify issues.
   ```python
   import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
   ```
